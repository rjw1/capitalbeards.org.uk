A word from Del our organizer:

Well I hope all you Capital Beards had a wonderful Christmas and now the
festivities are over it is now time to start planning for the New Year.  Sunday
11 January sees a return to the [Aeronaut](http://www.aeronaut.pub/) at [264
Acton High Street W3
9BH](http://www.openstreetmap.org/?mlat=51.50845&mlon=-0.27541#map=17/51.50845/-0.27541).

Acton is an interesting place.  Fans of Only Fools and Horses will be
interested to learn that the building described as “Nelson Mandela House”
Peckham is – in reality – Harlech Tower, Acton.  Acton was also the birthplace
of the Who, with three of them attending Acton County Grammar School.  Acton
has more claims to fame – it is the only place in the UK to have seven railway
stations bearing its name which leads to an embarrassment of choice regarding
public transport.  One of the best options is to walk north from Acton Town
Station on the Piccadilly and District lines.  You could also walk south down
Horns Lane from Acton Main Line, or – if you favour the Richmond line – Acton
Central is your stop – just walk south until you hit the A4020 – the Uxbridge
Road – where a right turn will take you to the pub.

Those of you who came last year will recall that the Aeronaut boasts an on site
brewing company ran by Laines of Brighton meaning you can get a pint straight
from barrel to bar. You can practically smell the hops. One of the beers they
are currently brewing is the 3.7ABV Acton Ale.  I can't remember what it tastes
like, but it certainly sounds like good session ale. The Aeronaut are also
proud of their selection of Sunday roasts.  So I hope to see you all there.
Just one more thing to tempt you along – as regulars will know, our socials
generally end with a visit to other local hostelries and while in Acton, we
will certainly check out the nearby George and Dragon – the home of the
excellent Dragonfly Brewery.
