A word from Del our Organizer:-

> On Saturday 16 May, the Capital Beards will be assembling in the Old Coffee
> House, Beak Street, Soho for drinks, a meal and convivial conversation.  For
> those of you with those new-fangled satnavs, the postcode is W1F 9SF.  As will
> come to no surprise to those that know me, despite its name, this is a pub and
> not a coffee house – more about this later.  You probably have your own
> favourite ways of accessing Soho, but the nearest tube station to the pub is
> Oxford Circus. Sadly, I am again unable to join in with the festivities;
> missing two meetings on the trot due to unavoidable clashes is barely
> forgivable.  I shall do better in future.
>
>
> Anyway, if you are interested in a bit about the pub, read on. If you feel life
> is too short, the article following this is really interesting.  For both of
> you who are still with me, I would like to take you back to Shakespearian times
> (see, you should have moved on to the next article!).  Shakespeare wrote
> Measure for Measure and All’s Well That Ends Well in rented accommodation in
> Silver Street Soho.  That building – along with a few others – was trashed
> during the Great Fire in 1666.  In 1680, Queen Ann’s messenger Thomas Beake,
> who also moonlighted as a property developer “acquired” most of Silver Street
> and being a courtier, he was a typical shrinking violet, so he renamed the
> street after himself.  I have no idea when the premises became a Coffee House,
> but in 1772, number 49 Beak Street was licensed as a public house under the
> more historic name of the Silver Street Coffee House.  The property was rebuilt
> and given its current name in 1894 and is currently Grade Two Listed.  Now
> something about the beer they sell.  You will be relieved to learn that I am
> only going back to the year 2000 for this.  In that year, the William IV pub at
> 816 High Road Leyton, opened a brewery in outbuildings of the pub at number
> 816A – the Sweet William Brewery.  This operated for four years until it closed
> in 2004.  In June 2008, the then owners of the pub, James and Lizzie Brodie,
> decided to clean up and restore the brewery and brewed the first batch of
> Brodies IPA on 8 August on that year.  They have been brewing ever since.  They
> love to try new recipes and – to date – have brewed over 150 different types of
> ales, several of which will be available at the Old Coffee House so I hope you
> will be able to make it on 16 May and  don’t forget to have a couple for me!
