title: Capital Beards 2015 October meeting at the Tapping the Admiral
---

Our next meeting will be at the [Tapping the Admiral](http://london.randomness.org.uk/wiki.cgi?Tapping_The_Admiral,_NW1_8SU) on the 18th of October.

A word from Del our Organizer:-

> The next event for the Capital Beards is a visit to Camden on Sunday 18
> October.  Always a vibrant place, in fact during our recent holiday in
> California, I took my wife, Yo, to Haight and Ashbury (or mission control for
> those, like me, who are in complete denial that we have moved on from the 60’s)
> and while I was trying to explain the history of the place, she just commented
> that Camden was much better – praise indeed!  The pub we shall be visiting is
> the excellent Tapping the Admiral at 77 Castle Road Camden Town NW1 8SU.
> 
> 
> Firstly, let’s deal with the name. In 1805, following Admiral Nelson’s victory
> and demise at the battle of Trafalgar, it was decided to bring his body back to
> England for a hero’s funeral. To keep the body in reasonable condition, his
> remains, it is said, were put in a cask of rum to preserve them on the voyage
> back to Britain. Sailors, who would do anything for a drink, bored a hole in
> the cask with a gimlet and drew off quantities of the rum through a straw. So
> many did so that when the body arrived in London the cask was found to be
> nearly empty.  This practice became known as Tapping the Admiral. It has also
> given us a brilliant pub name.  This Edwardian pub usually has 8 cask ales on
> tap and Chef James Spicer’s Sunday roasts are legendary. In CAMRA competitions
> it is a multi-award winner, and is in the frame for the current year.  This is
> reflected in a discount for CAMRA members, so bring your membership cards.
> Post meeting visits to the Devonshire Arms and the Camden Town Brewery are also
> very much on the cards for those of stout constitutions.

> Watch this space as exciting news regarding Capital Beards biggest event to date follows soon.
