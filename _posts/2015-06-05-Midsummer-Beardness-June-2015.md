A word from Del our Organizer:-

> This year, the Summer Solstice falls on Sunday 21 June.  The Solstice is when
> the tilt of a planet's axis is most inclined toward the Sun.  Who says you
> don’t learn anything by being a Capital Beards follower.  Anyway, what that
> means in practice is that the 21st is officially the first day of Summer and
> from that day until the Winter Equinox, the hours of daylight get shorter,
> which is why the term midsummer is often used colloquially.   Most cultures
> celebrate the Solstice with ceremonies relating to fertility.  The 21st is
> also Fathers’ Day - a day in which people who have proved their fertility are
> celebrated.  The coming together of these two events is being marked by the
> Capital Beards with a visit to The George at 77 Borough High Street, Borough,
> SE1 1NH from midday onwards. The nearest station is London Bridge.
>
>
> The George dates from the 17th century and is London's last remaining
> galleried inn and not surprisingly is Grade I listed. The building is owned
> by the National Trust and leased to Greene King (sorry about that, but they
> do usually have guest beers available!).  It has a large outdoor seating area
> in the cobbled courtyard in front of the pub and various ground floor
> drinking areas to check out.  There is also an upstairs Gallery Bar which is
> not always operating, but is usually available for a bit of exploring. 
>
> 
> Hope to see you all there.
