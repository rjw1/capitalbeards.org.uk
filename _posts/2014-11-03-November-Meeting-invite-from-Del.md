title: November Meeting invite from Del
---
Is the spirit of Halloween still with you?  Well that is good as the coming Sunday (November 9th) sees a walk on the wild side.  I hope you will all manage to take a trip to Whitechapel Station and, on leaving, turn left - tracing the steps of the infamous Jack the Ripper.  After about 100 yards, you will then pass the Blind Beggar where on the 9 March 1966, Ronnie Kray walked into the Saloon Bar and stood in front of George Cornell and calmly pulled out his 9mm Luger and shot him once in the forehead, just above his right eye.  As I am sure most of you will be aware, Ronald “Ronnie” Kray, together with his twin Reggie headed up a gang known simply as “The Firm” and spent the 50s and 60s organising armed robberies, arson, protection rackets, assaults and the odd murder here and there.  They were very good to their Mother though!  George Cornwall, together with his colleague “Mad” Frankie Frazer were “enforcers” for the South London Richardson Gang – another gang of charmers.  Bizarrely, this pub was also the location of William Booth’s first sermon, which led to the formation of the Salvation Army.  So, are we meeting here?  Well no, but I can’t resist a bit of distraction on the way.  We are actually meeting just across the Cambridge Heath Road at the [White Hart Brew Pub](http://www.the-white-hart.co.uk/home) [1 Mile End Road, London, EI 4TP](http://www.openstreetmap.org/?mlat=51.52011&mlon=-0.05621#map=17/51.52011/-0.05621).

The recent history of this pub has been a bit checkered, but now they are under new management they have put that all behind them.   They have carried out a major renovation, installing a 3.5 barrel microbrewery where Simon, the brewer previously with the award winning Redemption Brewery, is now working his magic.  Simon brews the full range of beers, and the pub also features a revolving list of guest beers. 

The pub is also proud of their freshly produced food which is locally sourced as far as possible.  Their traditional Sunday Roasts are gaining quite a following so, I hope to see you all on Sunday.

Cheers
